# lean-proofs

Logics and proofs in Lean.

## About

This repo contains the lean proofs that I explored and completed in the course of [CS2102](https://github.com/kevinsullivan/cs-dm) at UVa.

[Lessons folder](src/lessons) contains my class notes, which are basically the random mess that I typed in class.

I'm also working on the lean exercises at the end of each chapter in the openbook [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/). My answers are in the [chapter exercises](src/chapter_exercises) directory.
