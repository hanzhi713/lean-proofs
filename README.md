# lean-proofs

Logics and proofs in Lean.

## About

This repo contains the lean proofs that I explored and completed during the course of CS2102 at UVa.

[Lessons folder](lessons) contains my class notes, which are basically the random mess that I typed in class.

I'm also working on the lean exercises at the end of each chapter in the openbook [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/). My answers are in the [chapter exercises](chapter_exercises) directory.
